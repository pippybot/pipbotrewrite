These are the instructions on how to run Pipbot

Step 1:
  Make sure you have ALL the files downloaded on to your computer

Step 2:
  Set the files into the software machine application you will be using to run the bot (I use Virtual Studio Code)

Step 3:
  Go to the 'Client_Instantiation.js' file, and plug in the desired channel you want the bot to moderate.
  You will put the channel name under the channels line like so:
    [`${Channel_Name}`]
  If you want more than one channel being monitored (not recommended for smaller computers), you can put a comma
  between each backtick (`):
    [`${Channel_Name}`, `${Channel_Name}`]

Step 4:
  Once the machine is loaded up and the files are installed into the machine, go to the command prompt on the application
  
Step 5:
  Type "cd [filepath]". This will open the file path for the application to find the files and open them on your computer.

Step 6:
  Write "start [filename]"
  This will run the bot and allow you to see live chats in the command prompt.

Enjoy!
